## Hi Im Allan Aranda 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on improving my web development skills and building small projects to level up as a Full-Stack developer.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript, React, Node.js, and database management.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting web projects and anything that can challenge my coding skills.

🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices in full-stack development and project structuring.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript, web development, or gaming strategies.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a gamer who’s sometimes lazy, sometimes super productive — the perfect balance for coding marathons!
